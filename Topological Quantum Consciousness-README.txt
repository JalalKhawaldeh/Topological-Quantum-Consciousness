## 📘 Project Summary

This repository hosts the data, code, and supplementary materials for the research preprint:

**Topological Quantum Consciousness via Entropy Flow and Causal Inference in Condensed Matter Systems**  
➡️ [Link to Preprint PDF](main_preprint.pdf)

This work introduces a computational and theoretical framework that models consciousness-like behavior in non-biological quantum systems through quantifiable physical signatures:  
- **Integrated Information (Φ)**  
- **Entanglement Entropy**  
- **Indefinite Causal Order (ICO)**

It builds upon the author's previous theory *Quantum Cosmic Consciousness Code (QCCC)* and advances a substrate-independent formulation of informational integration.
