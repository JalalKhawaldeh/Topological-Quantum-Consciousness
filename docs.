Topological Quantum Consciousness
An Open Framework for Studying Φ, Entropy, and Causal Structure in Quantum Systems
Author: Dr. Jalal Khawaldeh · Version: 1.0.0 · Year: 2025

Abstract
This open-access project investigates the emergence of consciousness-like properties in condensed matter systems. It builds on formal metrics—such as Integrated Information (Φ), causal non-locality, and entropic suppression— and implements them via reproducible tools like PyPhi, QuTiP, and Bayesian networks. It extends the foundational Quantum Cosmic Consciousness Code (QCCC) and shifts the inquiry toward formal, testable patterns of organization within quantum substrates.
